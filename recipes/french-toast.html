   <h2>Description</h2>

   <p>This recipe is sure to be the one thing that actually makes you want
    to get up in the morning. I mean who doesn't want to wake up and shove 
    their mouth full of that sweet, delicous, thick, creamy, french toast.
    This recipe is luckily super easy to make, which is nice for those of us
    who want to put in minimal effort when we wake up in the morning to feed
    ourselves. All we need is 4 ingredients, a little morning will power and
    we're good to go.
